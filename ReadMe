Assignment: Songsaver
Today you are going to work on creating a Single Page Application (SPA) in
which you can save all your favorite songs with a rating.
Requirements
In order to meet the requirements of the (imaginary) employer, we expect your
SPA to meet the following core functionalities:
 As a user, I want to enter the following information about my song:
title, artist, genre, rating (dropdown menu is not required).
 As a user, I want to be able to click on one button so that my entered
song is added to my playlist.
 As a user, I want to be able to see my songs in an overview (my
playlist), in which all entered data are visible.

Other conditions
 You are completely free to build your components yourself: Stateful
and/or Smart versus Dumb, or with Class components, or Functional
Components (with the UseState Hook)....
o .....But, beware that you don&#39;t get spaghetti code, in which
each component does everything (managing State,
managing functions, and UI display, etc.)
Passed = Core Functionalities + 3 points (!)
In addition to these Core Functionalities above, you are required to choose 3
additional points from the list below.

Additional points:
 1 POINT – Sort the songs by name (a-z or z-a) or artist (a-z or z-a),
sort by stars (5-1 or 1-5)
 1 POINT – Delete button: delete songs from the state
 1 POINT – Categorize: each genre gets its own list and the song
you add ends up with the respective genre
 2 POINTS – Filter songs by:

o genre (select which genres you want) in the UI you see
either a dropdown with which you can select 1 genre, or
you create a checkbox per genre, if that checkbox is
checked: show the genre (so this can also be several or
none be one)
o stars (sort which results with x stars you want to see) in the
UI you see either a dropdown with which you can select 1
rating, or you create a checkbox per rating, if that checkbox
is checked: show all songs of that rating (this so there can
be several or none)

 2 POINTS
– Routing (/Navigation): add a navbar or menu with a link and page
&quot;About us &quot;, containing a short story about yourself and this project (max
10 sentences)
 2 POINTS – REDUX
design
This week the focus is 100% on React. Within React, all the &quot;logic&quot; and
functionality comes from using JavaScript with real-world examples. CSS
should be the last thing you work with.
But what should it look like?... (so this is just a guideline - you can certainly
deviate from this)

GitHub
 We would very much like to see you get the Core Functionalities
working on the final Master Branch.
 From this base, you can build any additional point you choose from
the list above from (and on) a separate feature industry (eg sorting).
o This has the advantage that, if you get stuck on a certain
feature, you can stop this work for a while to continue with
another feature.
o Later you can always come back to a feature by switching
to that branch

But..... we don&#39;t send you out without navigation. As a &quot;compass&quot; we give you
a piece of basic code that you have to point in the right direction to complete
this assignment.
(If you decide to use Redux, you will need to modify the base code below
slightly)
class SongOverview extends Component {
constructor() {
super()
this.state =

{
songs: []
}
}
addSong = (song) =&gt; {
// do something to change the state
}
render() {
return (
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;SongForm addSong={this.addSong}/&gt;
&lt;table style={{width: &quot;100%&quot;}}&gt;
&lt;tr className=&quot;song-header&quot;&gt;
&lt;th className=&quot;song-row__item&quot;&gt;Song&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th className=&quot;song-row__item&quot;&gt;Artist&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th className=&quot;song-row__item&quot;&gt;Genre&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th className=&quot;song-row__item&quot;&gt;Rating&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;SongList songs={this.state.songs}/&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
);
}
}
export default SongOverview;
